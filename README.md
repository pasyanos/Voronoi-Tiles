# Procedural Terrain Manipulation Using Voronoi Areas
Caroline Pasyanos
CSCI 716: Computational Geometry

### A playable demo is available [here](https://pasyanos.github.io/Voronoi-Tiles/)!

See the User Manual Section for more information on running the demo.

## Overview

Tile based terrain generation is a common approach to procedural terrain, but a major drawback is that it creates incredibly inorganic terrain. My project is a terrain generator that still relies on tiles while using Voronoi diagrams to create a more organic terrain generator.
